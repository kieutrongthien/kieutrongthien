  "aboutDescription": "Born and raised in Bien Hoa, Dong Nai, I have been passionate about computers, games, and websites since childhood. In my free time, I eagerly explored how they worked by watching tutorials on YouTube and experimenting on my own. Over time, I created various mods, tools, and especially websites, spending countless hours learning and building. What started as a curiosity eventually grew into a lifelong passion for web development and technology.",
